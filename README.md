# Jetpack Unplugged by ASU Engineering #

Jetpack Unplugged is a stripped down version of the amazing [Jetpack](https://github.com/Automattic/jetpack) plugin for WordPress. Our version of Jetpack contains only some bare essentials that we use on a regular basis within the Fulton Schools of Engineering at ASU.
- Runs without a connection to WordPress.com.
- All features are enabled by simply activating the plugin. No configuration required.

## Installing and Updating ##

Install the plugin manually by downloading a copy from this repository and uploading it to your `wp-content/plugins` directory. See [Installing a Plugin](https://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Manual_Plugin_Installation) in the WordPress Codex for additional instructions.

**Pro-Tip:** This plugin is compatible with the [GitHub Updater](https://github.com/afragen/github-updater) plugin for WordPress, which allows for regular updates to be applied via the WordPress admin screens. Installtion of GitHub Updater is recommended.

## Includes ##
JetPack Unplugged includes the following features from the original.
- [Widget Visibility](https://jetpack.com/support/widget-visibility/)

- [Shortcodes](https://jetpack.com/support/shortcode-embeds/): `[quiz]`, `[presentation]`, `[sitemap]`, `[pinterest]` and `[wufoo]`
